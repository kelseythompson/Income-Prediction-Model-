## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model, using R for customer income, leveraging externally sourced income data. 

By employing descriptive and summary statistics for each variable, performing multiple linear regression analysis, and formulating hypotheses, the project will evaluate the strength, direction, and impact of key predictors on churn, followed by an in-depth analysis of income factors. The ultimate goal is to uncover the significance and influence of these variables in driving income patterns.
